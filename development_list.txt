#List of things to implement

## Add license

## Loop microcontroller
activate DAC2 for voltage shift
make functions in the sketch
loop the aquisition for listening from the PC

## Loop python control
Send parameters (Pingpong script)
make analysis (FFT)

## Analog front-end
for DAC (voltage divider, voltage shift, activation relay)
for ADC (voltage shift)
transistor to drive the relay from the Teensy
additional transistors for 5V communication (trigger instrument)

## Real experiment
digital test (impendance DAC vs 2*ADC) to see resolution, linearity
real analog experiment interfaced with a potentiostat

## Future staff
Raspberry PI
portable potentiostat
different experiments (CV, battery cycles)
GUI
